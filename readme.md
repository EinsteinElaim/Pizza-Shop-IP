# Project Description
This is a web app for  My Pizza Shop. It's comprised of a welcome note on the top of the site, an About Us section that follows it which includes descriptions of My Pizza Shop and what we do there.

# Behaviour Driven Development
The user can choose from a variety of pizza styles such as the pizza size (from small, medium, large to mega) with each having different prices.

The user can choose the kind of toppings they like on their pizza with a variety of 10 different toppings whose prices vary depending on the pizza size. On this part, there is an exception for small pizza selection where if the user selects small pizza, they are not charged for the various toppings and the pizza base type(density of the base) and the price for all small pizzas remaining the same at 500/=

The bias explained above, however does not work for medium pizza sizes and above to mega pizza size. Instead, the prices change depending on the pizza size.

Also, the user can select the type of pizza base density they like which still has an exception for small pizza sizes where the price remains the same at 500/= but on the rest of the pizza sizes, they vary according to the pizza size.

And finally, the user can checkout their items by pressing the checkout button which gives the user a pop-up message which shows them the pizza size they have ordered, the toppings they selected and the final price to pay.
## Welcome Section
On opening the site, the user gets an interactive layout to the site with a welcome note from us at the pizza shop.
